- Project Name and Brief Description 
Touchdown Buddy is an add-on feature to the NFL’s interactive web and mobile applications that serves as a virtual assistant for everything NFL+. With the use of AI, Touchdown Buddy has the capability to provide commentary for game replays, highlights, and any other form of content on the NFL app. On top of this, the Touchdown Buddy will come with an AI chatbot feature to be able to answer any questions new fans may have when it comes to football. Lastly, the AI will be used to form recommendations for possible avatars, teams, and content on the app based on sign-up data, frequently watched content types, etc. This specific code/project serves as a sample of what our Touchdown Buddy’s capabilities may consist of.

6. The app is ready to run on a browser.

- Dependencies
All of our files are dependent on one another in order. A sample database was created with MySQL and the webpages were built with HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. You will need to implement the database to use the full features.
